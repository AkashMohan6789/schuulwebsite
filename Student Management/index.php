				<h1 class="heading2">EARLY LIFE & EDUCATION</h1><hr><br>

				<p>Malviya was born in<a href ="#"> Allahabad, North-Western Provinces</a>, India on 25 December 1861, in a<a href ="#"> Brahmin</a> family to Pandit Baijnath and Moona Devi Malviya. His ancestors, known for their<a href ="#"> Sanskrit </a>scholarship, originally hailed from<a href ="#"> Malwa</a> (Ujjain) in the present-day state of <a href ="#">Madhya Pradesh</a> and hence came to be known as 'Malviyas'. Their original surname was <a href ="#">Chaturvedi</a>. His father was also a learned man in Sanskrit scriptures, and used to recite the<a href ="#"> Srimad Bhagavatam.</a>

Malviya was traditionally educated at two Sanskrit Pathshalas and later continued education at an English school. Malaviya started his schooling at Hardeva's Dharma Gyanopadesh Pathshala, where he completed his primary education and later another school run by Vidha Vardini Sabha. He then joined Allahabad Zila School (Allahabad District School), where he started writing poems under the pen name Makarand which were published in journals and magazines.

Malviya matriculated in 1879 from the<a href ="#"> Muir Central College</a>, now known as <a href ="#">Allahabad University</a>. Harrison College's Principal provided a monthly scholarship to Malviya, whose family had been facing financial hardships, and he was able to complete his B.A. at the <a href ="#">University of Calcutta.</a>

Although he wanted to pursue an M.A. in Sanskrit, his family conditions did not allow it and his father wanted him to take his family profession of Bhagavat recital, thus in July 1884 Madan Mohan Malaviya started his career as an assistant master at the Govt High School in Allahabad.</p><br>

				<h1 class="heading2">LEGACY</h1><hr><br>
				<p>The slogan <a href ="#">Satyameva Jayate" </a>(Truth alone triumphs) is also a legacy given to the nation by Pandit Malaviya as the President of the Indian National Congress in its session of 1918 at Delhi, by saying that this slogan from the Mundakopanishad should be the slogan for the nation.

He started the tradition of <a href ="#">Aarti</a> at <a href ="#">Har ki Pauri Haridwar</a> to the sacred <a href ="#">Ganga river</a> which is performed till date. The <b>Malviya Dwipa</b>, a small island across the ghat, is named after him and carries his bust. The Indian Post issued stamps in his honour in 1961 and 2011 to celebrate his 100th and 150th birth anniversaries, respectively.

<a href ="#">Malviya Nagar</a> in Allahabad, Lucknow, Delhi, Dehradun, Bhopal, Durg and Jaipur are named after him. A square in main city at Jabalpur is named after him and is called <a href ="#">Malviya chowk</a>.Malaviya National Institute of Technology <a href ="#">(MNIT)</a> at Jaipur is named after him, as is<a href ="#"> Madan Mohan Malaviya University of Technology in Gorakhpur</a>, UP. The Hostels of IIT Kharagpur, IIT Roorkee Saharanpur Campus and BITS Pilani, Pilani and Hyderabad campuses are also named Malviya Bhawan after him. In memory of him, Shrigoud Vidya Mandir, Indore celebrate his birth anniversary as Mahamana Divas on every 25 December. They have also declared a fellowship programme for poor Sanatan Vipra boys on this day.
